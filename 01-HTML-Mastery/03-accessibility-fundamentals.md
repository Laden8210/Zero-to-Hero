# Accessibility Fundamentals: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to Web Accessibility

### What is Web Accessibility?
**Web accessibility** is the practice of designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies that people with disabilities can use effectively. It ensures that all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web.

### Why We Need Accessibility
- **Legal Requirements**: Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility (ADA, Section 508, AODA, EN 301 549)
- **Moral Imperative**: Equal access to information is a basic human right
- **Business Benefits**: Expands your audience to include people with disabilities (15-20% of population)
- **Better UX for Everyone**: Accessibility features often improve the experience for all users
- **SEO Benefits**: Accessible sites are typically more search-engine friendly

## ARIA Landmarks and Roles: Creating Semantic Structure

### What They Are
**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Landmarks and roles provide semantic meaning to page sections that assistive technologies can understand.

### What They're Used For
- **Document Structure**: Helps screen readers understand page organization
- **Navigation**: Allows users to jump between important sections
- **Context**: Provides meaning to custom widgets and dynamic content

### Benefits
- **Screen Reader Navigation**: Users can quickly navigate to key sections
- **Better Orientation**: Helps users understand where they are on the page
- **Future-Proofing**: Works with evolving assistive technologies

### Implementation Example
```html
<!-- Header landmark identifies the page header -->
<header role="banner" aria-label="Site header">
    <!-- Navigation landmark for main navigation -->
    <nav role="navigation" aria-label="Primary navigation">
        <!-- Content -->
    </nav>
</header>

<!-- Main content landmark -->
<main role="main" id="main-content">
    <!-- Article landmark for self-contained content -->
    <article role="article">
        <!-- Content -->
    </article>
</main>

<!-- Footer landmark -->
<footer role="contentinfo" aria-label="Site footer">
    <!-- Content -->
</footer>
```

## ARIA Labels and Descriptions: Enhancing Understanding

### What They Are
**ARIA labels and descriptions** provide additional context and information that isn't readily apparent from the visual presentation alone.

### What They're Used For
- **Form Instructions**: Clarifying input requirements
- **Error Messages**: Announcing validation errors
- **Complex Widgets**: Explaining custom interface components

### Benefits
- **Clarity**: Provides explicit instructions and feedback
- **Context**: Helps users understand the purpose of elements
- **Error Prevention**: Reduces user mistakes with clear guidance

### Implementation Example
```html
<!-- Input with multiple descriptions -->
<input 
    type="password" 
    id="password" 
    aria-describedby="password-help password-requirements"
    aria-required="true"
>
<!-- Help text description -->
<div id="password-help" class="help-text">
    Your password must be secure
</div>
<!-- Requirements description -->
<div id="password-requirements" class="requirements">
    Must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
</div>

<!-- Error message with live region -->
<div id="password-error" role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
    Password does not meet requirements
</div>
```

## ARIA States and Properties: Dynamic Content Communication

### What They Are
**ARIA states and properties** communicate the current condition of elements, especially important for dynamic content that changes without page reloads.

### What They're Used For
- **Dynamic Updates**: Announcing content changes
- **Component States**: Communicating open/closed, expanded/collapsed states
- **Progress Indicators**: Showing completion status

### Benefits
- **Real-time Updates**: Keeps users informed of changes
- **State Awareness**: Helps users understand interface status
- **Interactive Feedback**: Provides confirmation of user actions

### Implementation Example
```html
<!-- Accordion with state management -->
<button 
    aria-expanded="false" 
    aria-controls="accordion-content"
    id="accordion-trigger"
>
    Section Title
</button>
<div 
    id="accordion-content" 
    aria-labelledby="accordion-trigger"
    aria-hidden="true"
>
    Content that shows when expanded
</div>

<!-- Progress bar with current value -->
<div 
    role="progressbar" 
    aria-valuenow="75" 
    aria-valuemin="0" 
    aria-valuemax="100"
    aria-label="File upload progress"
>
    75% complete
</div>
```

## Keyboard Navigation: Ensuring Full Operability

- **Skip Links**: Allow users to bypass repetitive content
- **Keyboard Traps**: Prevent users from getting stuck in modal dialogs

### Implementation Example
```html
<!-- Skip link for keyboard users -->
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>

<!-- Custom widget with keyboard support -->
<div class="custom-dropdown">
    <button 
        aria-expanded="false" 
        aria-haspopup="true"
        tabindex="0"
    >
        Select Option
    </button>
    <ul role="menu" aria-hidden="true">
        <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">Option 1</li>
        <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">Option 2</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

## Screen Reader Support: Auditory Interface Compatibility

        <tr>
            <th scope="row">January</th>
            <td>$10,000</td>
            <td>+5%</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<!-- Complex widget with screen reader support -->
<div role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="color-label">
    <h3 id="color-label">Select Color</h3>
    <div role="radio" aria-checked="true" tabindex="0">Red</div>
    <div role="radio" aria-checked="false" tabindex="-1">Blue</div>
    <div role="radio" aria-checked="false" tabindex="-1">Green</div>
</div>
```

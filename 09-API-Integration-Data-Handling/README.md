# API Integration & Data Handling Lesson

## Overview
This lesson covers RESTful API consumption, modern data fetching approaches, state management for API data, and error handling patterns. Master these concepts to build robust applications that interact with backend services.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand RESTful API principles and HTTP methods
- Implement modern data fetching with Fetch API and libraries
- Handle server state vs client state effectively
- Apply error handling and loading state patterns
- Implement optimistic updates and caching strategies
- Design robust API integration architectures

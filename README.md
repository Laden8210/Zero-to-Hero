## üß† Frontend Development Philosophy

### Core Principles of Modern Frontend Development
Frontend development has evolved from simple page styling to building complex, interactive user interfaces. The modern frontend developer must master multiple domains including user experience, performance optimization, accessibility, and maintainable code architecture.

### Mental Models for Frontend Development
- **Component-Based Thinking**: Breaking down UIs into reusable, self-contained pieces
- **Declarative Programming**: Describing what the UI should look like for any given state
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows down, events flow up
- **Separation of Concerns**: Structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) working together
